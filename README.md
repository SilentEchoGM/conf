### Silent's Coding Configuration

#### (for use with the CharaChorder One)

This is the (CCOS manager)[https://manager.charachorder.com/config/layout/] backup of my CharaChorder One configuration and the modified version of the US Keymap that I made with Microsoft's Keyboard Layout Creator to sidestep some of the shift key holding that CCOS does when remapping symbols.

Also keeping some VSCode settings in here as well.
